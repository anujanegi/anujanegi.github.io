I'm a master's student at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/), Berlin, pursuing a joint degree from the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) (TU Berlin) and the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) (HU Berlin). Before that, I got my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [Vellore Institute of Technology](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/), India.

I am curious about data representation in the brain, connectomics and translational neuroscience, and am an open science passionate! Currently on the lookout for a PhD position to continue my academic journey :)
