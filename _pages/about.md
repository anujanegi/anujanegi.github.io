I'm a PhD student at [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) (TU Berlin), supervised by [Fatma Deniz](https://www.fatmanet.com/). I am curious how data is represented in our brains and the underlying connectomics that allow this. My current research focuses on language processing and learning.


Before this, I did my masters in Computational Neuroscience at [BCCN Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/). During this time, I was fortunate to work with [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/), [Stefan Haufe](https://www.tu.berlin/uniml/about/head-of-group), and [Petra Ritter](https://www.brainsimulation.org/bsw/zwei/team-ritter). I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [VIT Chennai](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/).

I'm passionate about science communication and outreach. Currently, I'm organizing [SoapBox Science Berlin](http://soapboxscience.org/berlin-local-organising-team/) and the [German Neuroscience Olympiad](https://neurowissenschaften-olympiade.de/locations/dno-berlin/).
