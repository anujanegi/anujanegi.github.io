I'm a masters student at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/), Berlin, pursuing a joint degree from the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) (TU Berlin) and the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) (HU Berlin). Before that, I got my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [VIT](http://chennai.vit.ac.in/), India.

I work on machine learning, deep learning and computational neuroscience. I'm especially interested in understanding the computational foundations of natural intelligence.
